# BurnDown Docs

A burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time.

The outstanding work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. Burn down charts are a run chart of outstanding work. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed. 

It is often used in agile software development methodologies such as Scrum. However, burn down charts can be applied to any project containing measurable progress over time.

## Why 

While working on an agile proyect, me and my team needed a way of generate our burn down charts on an easy way, and we noticed that the majority of them where payed apps with tons of functions that we didn't need so we decided to make our own app for that.

## Ideal Work Remaining Line

There is an ideal work remaining line, which is a straight line connecting the start point to the end point. It shows the sum of the estimates for all the tasks that need to be completed. At the end point, the ideal line crosses the x-axis and shows there is no work left to be done. This line is based on estimates and therefore not always accurate.

## Actual Work Remaining Line

Then there is the actual work remaining line that shows the actual work that remains in the project or iteration. At the beginning the actual work remaining and the ideal work remaining are the same, but as the project or iteration progresses the actual work line will fluctuate above and below the ideal work line. Each day a new point is added to this line until the project or iteration is done to make sure itâ€™s as accurate as possible.

If the actual work line is above the ideal work line, it means there is more work left than originally thought. In other words, the project is behind schedule. However, if the actual work line is below the ideal work line, there is less work left than had been predicted and the project is ahead of schedule.
